MANIFEST
========

basics/
   * defines the basic theory of nominal sets (principally, the notion
     of a permutation acting on a type).
   * establishes a type of lambda-calculus terms, including a notion
     of substitution
   * provides some ML support for working in the nominal environment

barendregt/
   * mechanisation of chapter 2 from Hankin, and chapters 3 and (most
     of) 11 from Barendregt's book.

other-models/
   * lots of different models of the lambda-calculus.  Most are
     related back to the term type in basics, and the notion of beta
     reduction that is defined in barendregt/chap3Theory.

typing/
   * type systems for the  lambda calculus, focussing on simple type
     theory.
