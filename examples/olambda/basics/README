basic_swapScript.sml
   Very basic theory of swaps over strings (the swapstr constant), and
   permutations (which take a list of pairs of strings to swap).  Also
   defines the NEW constant, which is used everywhere (including in
   the dB and nc developments above).

nomsetScript.sml
   A more involved theory of permutations and their actions on
   arbitrary types (the "nominal sets").  Includes the notion of
   support.

NEWLib.{sig,sml}
   simple tactics to use with the NEW constant.

binderLib.{sig,sml}
   Tools for doing proofs with terms that include binders, including
   function definition and facilities from NEWLib.

pretermScript.sml termScript.sml
   Using a quotient over raw syntax from pretermTheory, establishes a
   type of lambda calculus terms, and defines substitution, the notion
   of free variable and permutations over that type.  Proves some
   simple lemmas about substitution.  For example,

     lemma14a: |- [VAR x/x] t = t
